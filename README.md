Hello, and welcome to my personal GenAI repo where I've shared my personal projects done in Generative AI with like minded enthusiasts.

I've leveraged Amazon Bedrock as my model runtime here to trigger FM's. You might choose to use similar toolchain like Google Collab or any other that you prefer.

This repo contains code related to the following...


RAG based approach:

1/ Using Langchain to query model for answers based off a Vector Store & Embeddings (PDF document).

2/ Text Summarization using Amazon Titan Text Express v1 through Bedrock runtime by sending API requests via Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.

3/ Image Generation using Amazon Titan Image Generator through Bedrock runtime by sending API requests via Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda.


Other approach(s):

4/ Generating a text model using FM's,
- Llama-2 13b v1
- Amazon Titan Text express v1

5/ Generating an image model using FM's,
- Stability Diffusion AI XL v1
- Amazon Titan Image Generator v1
